If you have lot of users / clients and you are using other payment method for orders than Stripe, I will recommend full project backup, database and files. Afterwords you will need to download the desired payment method, and set up the way you like it. Please look into the update video to see what has been changed in the payment methods. Restaurants will need to reset the api keys for Mollie or PayPal if they where accepting direct payments.
