## Error 500 on migrating languages

**Problem**  
Before, 2.0.8 if you try to migrate language you can get error 500. 
And some of the item like the categories, can be translated multiple times like ```{en:\\\en:\\\......}```

**Reason**  
This happens because we didn't look into object active status.
And script crashed when it tried to translate un-active record.

**Solution**  
Update to 2.0.8+
For the ```{en:\\\en:\\\......}```, if you don't have lot of data, you can manually edit them from the admin.
If you have lot of data, 
- Export the categories and items table
- Find replace, so it looks normal
- Delete categories and items by ignoring foreign keys and import again
Or ask for help from us. 

Then make the translation migration again. Now should go fine.

## Error on uploading an image 

**Error**

"PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed

**Reason**  
 "PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed/enabled to use Intervention Image."

The project needs the [fileinfo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png) extension. 

**Solution**

As you can see on the [image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png), it can be enabled from PHP Selector. But if there is no  PHP Selector you should have access to **WHM**.

**IN WHM**

Initially, we login to WHM and navigate as follows,

Software &gt;&gt; EasyApache 4 &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; PHP extensions.

Here we search for **fileinfo** and enable phpx.x-php-fileinfo for all versions. Finally, we click on Review and Provision.

This enables the file extension for all the PHP websites in the server.

Let me know about this.
