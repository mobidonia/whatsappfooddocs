## Error 500 on migrating languages

**Problem**  
Before, 2.0.8 if you try to migrate language you can get error 500. And some of the item like the categories, can be translated multiple times like `{en:\\\en:\\\......}`

**Reason**  
This happens because we didn't look into object active status. And script crashed when it tried to translate un-active record.

**Solution**  
Update to 2.0.8+ For the `{en:\\\en:\\\......}`, if you don't have lot of data, you can manually edit them from the admin. If you have lot of data,

* Export the categories and items table
* Find replace, so it looks normal
* Delete categories and items by ignoring foreign keys and import again

  Or ask for help from us. 

Then make the translation migration again. Now should go fine.

## SQL Error - Table not found

**Error**  
After installation, when you open your site, you see an error screen with a report similar to this.

```text
local.ERROR: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'plan.plan_id'
```

**Reason**  
The most common problem for this is because you have entered the wrong credentials/user/pass for the Database and the setup of the database was incomplete.

**Solution**

1. Open the file **.env** and make sure you have entered the correct  DB data

## Error on uploading an image

**Error**

"PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed

**Reason**  
"PHP Fileinfo extension must be installed/enabled to use Intervention Image."

The project needs the [fileinfo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png) extension.

**Solution**

As you can see on the [image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vhN3E.png), it can be enabled from PHP Selector. But if there is no PHP Selector you should have access to **WHM**.

**IN WHM**

Initially, we login to WHM and navigate as follows,

Software &gt;&gt; EasyApache 4 &gt;&gt; Customize &gt;&gt; PHP extensions.

Here we search for **fileinfo** and enable phpx.x-php-fileinfo for all versions. Finally, we click on Review and Provision.

This enables the file extension for all the PHP websites in the server.

Let me know about this.
