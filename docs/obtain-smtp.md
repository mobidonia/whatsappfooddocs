## Why I need it

You will need to have SMTP \( way to send mail \) because the system will use it to

* Send password reset email
* Order related notifications 



####  SMTP from shared hosting

This is probably the easiest way to obtain SMTP data. Create an email in your hosting and get note of the credentials. You will need them in the install process.
