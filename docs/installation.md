### Installation on Shared Hosting

Plesk / cPanel and other hosting managers are recommended. In this guide, we will use Plesk but similar should be for others.

#### 1. Create your domain or subdomain in your shared hosting

After you have created that, you will be able to access the file manager for that domain/subdomain

Delete any default files that are maybe added.

#### 2. Create a database

Create an empty database in your shared hosting and remember this credentials

* db name
* db username
* db user pass


#### 3.  Upload the source code you have downloaded from CodeCanyon and unzip it

#### 4. Now navigate to the web url where your project is located

ex. mydomain.com or subdomain.mydomain.com

The installation screen should appear and guide you in the process.

When you login as admin, in Site Settings you have the option to change all the settings.
