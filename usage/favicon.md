# Favicon

Since this is PWA app, the best way to change the favicon together with the icon used in the PWA app is to use the Real Favicon generator \( [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) \)

Then upload your icon with at least 260x260 size.  PNG or JPG. 

Then go over the listing, and make sure you icon looks good. You ca also enter app name there.

Next, download the Favicon package. This zip contains all the needed favicons for both the site and the PWA. 

You can upload the zip, and extract in the **public** folder. Or Export locally and upload the files in the public folder.
