## Run locally

In Laravel 8, there is new package available called [https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail](Laravel Sail). 

We use this to run the site locally, and test it. 

All you need is to install [https://www.docker.com/](Docker) in your compute.

After that, open the code and execute the command

```text
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

You can add alias for the sail command. 

Then open the site on localhost, and the install window should appear.
