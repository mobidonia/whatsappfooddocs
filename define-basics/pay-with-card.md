# Pay with card

The pay with card in enabled with Stripe. So if you check to enable Stripe, customers of the restaurant can pay with a card. 

The problem is that this money goes to your stripe account \( Admin stripe account \). And later you should do transfer to them. 

With [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect),  you have the option, the money customers pay via ordering with online card payment, to be directly transferred to restaurants stripe account. 

You can manage the fees you want to charge the restaurant, in the restaurant edit page.
