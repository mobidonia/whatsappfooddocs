# Google API

## Make a Google Project and enable APIs

To use the Maps JavaScript, Places API and Geolocation API you must have an API key. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes.

To get an API key:

1. Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

   2. Click the project drop-down and select or create the project for which you want to add an API key.

The **API key created** dialog displays your newly created API key.

The new API key is listed on the **Credentials** page under **API keys**.  
\(Remember to [restrict the API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#restrict_key) before using it in production.\) 

7. Click on **RESTRICT KEY**.

An application restriction controls which websites, IP addresses, or applications can use your API key. You can set one application restriction per key.

* Select **HTTP referrers \(web sites\)**
* Click on **ADD AN ITEM** and add your domain. Your domain should look like this: `https://yourdomain.com/*` and `yourdomain.com/*`

* Select **Restrict key**.
* Click on **Select APIs drop down menu** and select **Maps JavaScript API** and **Places API** and **GeoCoding API**

Now your API Key is ready for use.

8. Copy the API Key and paste in your `.env` file

```text
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="" //API KEY
```



### Possible problems

{% hint style="info" %}
**IMPORTANT:** Please make sure that everything is working okay \(showing maps and adding new client address in order checkout page\).  
{% endhint %}

  
1. **Change application restrictions**   
  
Depending on your server/domain configuration the script maybe won't accept the **HTTP referrers** restrictions so try with changing the application restrictions back to **None**

2. **Enable Billing on your project.**

Sometimes after adding the key these features maybe won't work again. Then depending on the google account associated with the project created and maybe you will need to enable Billing.
